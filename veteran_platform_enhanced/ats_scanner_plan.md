# ATS Scanner Implementation Plan

## Overview
The ATS Scanner component will allow veterans to analyze their resumes against job descriptions to determine ATS compatibility and provide suggestions for improvement. This component will help veterans optimize their resumes for applicant tracking systems to increase their chances of getting interviews.

## User Interface Requirements

### Upload Interface
- Resume upload area (supporting PDF and DOCX formats)
- Job description input area (text field for pasting job descriptions)
- Scan button to initiate analysis

### Analysis Results Display
1. **Overall Score Section**
   - Numerical score out of 100
   - Visual representation (progress bar, gauge, etc.)
   - Brief summary of strengths and weaknesses

2. **Keyword Analysis Section**
   - List of keywords found in the job description
   - Indication of which keywords are present/missing in the resume
   - Keyword density visualization

3. **Format Analysis Section**
   - Assessment of resume format compatibility with ATS systems
   - Identification of formatting issues (tables, graphics, headers/footers)
   - File format compatibility check

4. **Content Analysis Section**
   - Assessment of section organization
   - Passive vs. active voice analysis
   - Identification of overused words or phrases

5. **Improvement Suggestions Section**
   - Actionable recommendations for improving ATS compatibility
   - Highlighted text showing suggested changes
   - Option to download a detailed report as PDF

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components
1. **FileUploadComponent.js** - For resume upload functionality
2. **JobDescriptionInput.js** - For job description input
3. **ScannerResults.js** - For displaying analysis results
4. **ScoreDisplay.js** - For visualizing the overall score
5. **KeywordAnalysis.js** - For keyword matching visualization
6. **FormatAnalysis.js** - For format compatibility display
7. **ContentAnalysis.js** - For content quality assessment
8. **SuggestionsList.js** - For improvement recommendations
9. **PDFReportGenerator.js** - For creating downloadable reports

### Backend Processing (Simulated)
1. **Resume Parser** - Extract text and structure from uploaded resumes
2. **Keyword Extractor** - Identify important keywords from job descriptions
3. **Format Analyzer** - Check resume format for ATS compatibility
4. **Content Analyzer** - Assess content quality and organization
5. **Scoring Algorithm** - Calculate overall compatibility score
6. **Suggestion Generator** - Create actionable improvement recommendations

### Mock Data and Simulation
For demonstration purposes, we'll create:
- Sample resume parsing results
- Common ATS compatibility issues
- Industry-specific keyword libraries
- Format compatibility rules
- Content quality metrics
- Scoring algorithms based on industry standards

## Implementation Steps

1. Create the file upload and job description input interface
2. Implement resume text extraction (simulated for PDFs and DOCXs)
3. Develop keyword extraction and matching functionality
4. Create format analysis visualization
5. Implement content quality assessment
6. Develop scoring algorithm and visualization
7. Create improvement suggestions generator
8. Implement PDF report generation
9. Add styling to match the platform's design system
10. Test with various resume formats and job descriptions

## Integration Points
- Will consume resume data from the Resume Generator component
- Could provide feedback to improve the Resume Generator templates

## Technical Requirements
- JavaScript for frontend functionality
- PDF.js for PDF parsing (simulated)
- Chart.js for data visualization
- jsPDF for report generation
- Local storage for saving scan results
- CSS/SCSS for styling

## Accessibility Considerations
- All form elements will have proper labels and ARIA attributes
- Color contrast will meet WCAG standards
- Keyboard navigation will be fully supported
- PDF reports will be accessible and properly tagged

## User Experience Considerations
- Clear instructions for optimal file formats
- Real-time feedback during scanning process
- Intuitive visualization of results
- Actionable and specific improvement suggestions
- Easy navigation between results sections
