# Skill Translator Implementation Plan

## Overview
The Skill Translator component will allow veterans to input their military experience and receive civilian-equivalent skills, job titles, and industry recommendations. This is a core component of the platform that will feed data to other components like the Resume Generator.

## User Interface Requirements

### Input Form
- Military rank dropdown (e.g., E-1 through E-9, O-1 through O-10, W-1 through W-5)
- Military branch dropdown (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, Space Force)
- Military trade/role text input with autocomplete suggestions
- Years of experience numeric input (1-30+)
- Additional certifications/specializations text area
- Submit button

### Results Display
Three main sections:
1. **Equivalent Job Titles** - List of 3-5 civilian job titles with match percentage
2. **Transferable Skills** - Two columns: Hard skills and Soft skills
3. **Recommended Industries** - List of industries with brief explanations of fit

### Additional Features
- Download results as PDF button
- Feedback mechanism (thumbs up/down for each suggested job title)
- Edit/refine results option

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components
1. **SkillTranslatorForm.js** - React component for the input form
2. **TranslationResults.js** - React component for displaying results
3. **PDFGenerator.js** - Utility for creating downloadable PDF
4. **FeedbackWidget.js** - Component for thumbs up/down feedback

### Data Processing
1. **Military role to civilian mapping** - JSON dataset of military roles and civilian equivalents
2. **Skills extraction** - Logic to extract and categorize skills based on military experience
3. **Industry recommendation algorithm** - Logic to match military background to suitable industries

### Mock Data
For demonstration purposes, we'll create a comprehensive dataset of:
- Military ranks across all branches
- Common military roles/trades and their civilian equivalents
- Skills typically associated with military roles
- Industries that commonly hire veterans with specific backgrounds

## Implementation Steps

1. Create the basic form UI with all input fields
2. Implement form validation and submission handling
3. Create the results display UI with all three sections
4. Implement the PDF download functionality
5. Add the feedback mechanism
6. Connect all components with mock data
7. Add styling to match the platform's design system
8. Test with various input combinations

## Integration Points
- Results will be made available to the Resume Generator component
- Feedback data would eventually be used to improve recommendations (in a real system)

## Technical Requirements
- React for UI components
- jsPDF for PDF generation
- Local storage for saving user inputs temporarily
- CSS/SCSS for styling

## Accessibility Considerations
- All form elements will have proper labels and ARIA attributes
- Color contrast will meet WCAG standards
- Keyboard navigation will be fully supported
